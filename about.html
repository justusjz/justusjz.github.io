    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm justusjz. I love programming and am particularly interested in
      programming languages (especially Lisp, Forth, and Rust, though I am most
      familiar with C, C++, C#, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java), operating
      systems, graphics programming, virtual machines and untrusted code
      execution, cryptography, compression, and game development. There are
      probably lots of things I forgot. As you can see though, web design isn't
      really something I care about.
    </p>

      I live in Karlsruhe, Germany, where I am studying computer science. Also,
      I'm working remotely as a backend developer for WeMakeFuture AG. Although
      both of these things have to do with programming, my love for programming
      extends much further, and I truly enjoy writing about everything I learn.
      I hope you find something here that fascinates you as much as it does me!
    </p>

      If you're wondering, I'm using Visual Studio Code for most things, but
      I've installed an Emacs Emulator extension, and if I could, I'd use real
      Emacs. Also, despite having used Windows for most of my life, I've
      recently fallen in love with Arch, and I can't wait to install it on my
      main laptop.
