      Hi, I'm justusjz. This is my blog about anything programming-related that
      fascinates me.

    <h2>Creating a Blog</h2>
    <p>February 20, 2024</p>

      I'm always working on lots of projects privately, and I enjoy telling my
      coworkers about it. A couple of weeks ago, one of them proposed that I
      should write a blog about those projects, so other people could see what
      I'm doing and maybe even give me some ideas. After thinking about it for a
      while, I decided that it was a great idea, and got to work. At first, I
      researched some systems to design blogs. One of the first ones I found was
      Jekyll, which can be easily used with GitHub Pages. However, Jekyll
      doesn't have direct support for comments, and I thought a comment system
      would be quite nice, because I like to know what others are thinking about
      my work. Also, sometimes I overlook something very simple, so it might be
      good to have someone point those things out. Therefore, I decided to
      abandon Jekyll, and find my own solution.
