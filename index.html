		<h2>Creating a Blog</h2>
		<p>February 20, 2024</p>
		<p>
			I'm always working on lots of projects privately, and I enjoy telling my
			coworkers about it. A couple of weeks ago, one of them proposed that I
			should write a blog about those projects, so other people could see what
			I'm doing and maybe even give me some ideas. After thinking about it for a
			while, I decided that it was a great idea, and got to work.
